# Applied-Graphical-Network-Analysis-using-Python
In this project we have analyzed the Nashville-meetup network.
meetup.com is a website for people organizing and attending regular or semi-regular events ("meet-ups"). The relationships amongst users—who goes to what meetups—are a social network, ideal for graph-based analysis.
We have analyzed the Nashville-meetup network to determine the following results:

•Who are the people who most influence the network?

•Who are the people who influence the transfer of information?

•Which are the best performers in information transfer?

To assign roles and make categories between individuals we will calculate mathematical indicators from the theory of complex graphs:

The centrality of proximity: This indicator makes it possible to detect the individuals who have a significant power on the transfer of information. Individuals with a large centralized proximity have the ability to contact a very large number of individuals easily

The betweenness centrality: This indicator can detect individuals who influence the transfer of information. If these individuals do not exist in the network, then the information can not flow on both sides of the network.

The eigenvector centrality: The individuals having a high spectral centralized are the individuals who have the most relation in the network, they are central and have influence in a general way on the network.

we have also done the graph visualization for a section of the members to understand better.
